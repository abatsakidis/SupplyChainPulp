## What is PuLP ##

* PuLP is a modeling framework for Linear (LP) and Integer Programing (IP) problems written in Python

* Maintained by COIN-OR Foundation (Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research)

* PuLP interfaces with Solvers
  * CPLEX
  * COIN
  * Gurobi
  * etcâ€¦
  
## Common modeling process for PuLP ##

1. Initialize Model
2. Define Decision Variables
3. Define Objective Function 
4. Define the Constraints
5. Solve Model
